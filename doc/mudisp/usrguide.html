<h3><a name="step1">Creating your workdesk</a></h3>
  The MuDiSP collection of libraries  must be installed on your system and
you must know the location of it. Contact your system administrator to know
the full path to the MuDiSP directory and remember it. As an example let's
suppose that the MuDiSP3 is installed in the following path: 
<p>  <code>MuDiSP3 Installation Path = /usr/local/mudisp3</code> </p>
<p>   Next, create a project directory in your personal disk space with a
subdirectory which will contain your C++ sources. For example if your personal
home directory is : </p>
<p> <code>/home/gargiulo</code> </p>
<p>  you can create the project directory MYPROJECT under <code>/home/gargiulo</code>
 with the following UNIX&nbsp; commands: </p>
<p> <code> &gt; cd /home/gargiulo<br>
 &gt; mkdir MYPROJECT<br>
 &gt; cd MYPROJECT<br>
 </code> </p>
<p>  Then you create a subdirectory of the project dir where to place the
source code of your system. As an example, create the sources directory <code>src</code>
this way: </p>
<p>  <code> &gt; mkdir src<br>
 </code> </p>
<p>If you prefere, there is a demo running project in the installation directory.
An easy way to start programming with MuDiSP3 is to copy the entire demo
directory with:<br>
</p>
<p> <code> &gt; cp -r /usr/local/mudisp3/demoproject ~<br>
&gt; cd demoproject </code> </p>
<p>Now you have to edit the first lines of the Makefile in order to reflect
your system.  Usually you only have to add the <em>cpp</em> files that you
create in the source directory. The sections of the Makefile to be edited
are clearly indicated by comments. </p>
<p>You have all you need to begin to create your personal block library.
Each block you create will have a couple of files in the <em>src</em> directory:
myblock.h and myblock.cpp for example. Then the system.h and system.cpp is
modified in order to include your blocks and,  eventually, other library
blocks made available by others.  </p>
<p> In the next section you will discover how the simulator works (not in
detail)&nbsp; that will help you understand the steps to build your system.
