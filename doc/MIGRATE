If you are an INeSiS user (software bundle containing the MuDiSP2
package) this file is right for you. 
 
The current release of the simulation environment is not too far from
the previous one from the user's side. The migration is simply
obtained through these simple steps:

1--
save the old version of the Makefile in your project directory

2--
copy the new Makefile from the location /usr/local/mudisp3/demoproject 
and place it in your project directory

3--
merge all the necessary data from the saved old Makefile into the new
one (you probably want to change the USERPROJECT USERDIRS and USERSRC
sections)

NOTE: (GCC 3.X USERS)

If you're using Gcc version 3.o or later you may need to change something in your source files as well, to make it compliant to the new gcc release.

Here are some hints:

--- substitute "void main(" with "int main(" in your main.cpp

--- eliminate empty class prototypes, such as "class System:public Block;" found in many main.cpp

--- use really "standard" standard template libraries and includes


That's all. 


For experts users a couple of lines of explanation. The new Makefiles
refer to the variable "MDSP3_SRC" which substitutes "INESIS". Also the
value of this variable must point to the new installation location
"/usr/local/mudisp3" (previously "/usr/local/inesis"). If you chose
another directory for installing the simulation engine change the
provious paths accordingly.
